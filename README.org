* Prerequisites
- Nim ([[https://nim-lang.org/]])
- Install *musl* library from [[https://www.musl-libc.org/download.html]]
  and note the path to ~musl_gcc~ binary.
* How to generate static binary
1. Update the ~muslGcc~ constant in ~config.nims~ with *your* path to
   ~musl-gcc~ binary.
2. Run ~nimble stat~.

That will generate ~hello_musl~ binary in the current directory.

- ~ldd ./hello_musl~ will print "not a dynamic executable".
- ~./hello_musl~ will print "Hello, World!"

* TODO Todo-List
- [ ] Don't hard-code the ~muslGcc~ const in the ~musl~ task in ~config.nims~
- [ ] Not require ~hello_musl.nimble~
  - Currently that is needed just to add the ~-d:release~ switch and
    to auto-run ~strip -s~ after running ~nim musl~.
  - So to remove dependency on this file, I need to figure out how to
    get the current /foo.nim/ file name from within the ~config.nims~.
- [ ] Figure out how to have ~nimble install~ install the binary
  generated by ~nimble stat~.

Eventual goal is to reuse the same ~config.nims~ for all projects. So
I cannot hardcode the ~pkgName~ as I do in ~hello_musl.nimble~.
